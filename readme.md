# DevBoard â€“ Personalized Public Developer Dashboards

DevBoard is a platform for developers and indie hackers to create customizable public dashboards.  
It will integrate GitHub, Twitter, blogs, and more to showcase projects, track goals, and connect with others.

## âœ… What Is It?

DevBoard is a **public developer profile dashboard** builder that allows you to:

- Aggregate **live GitHub stats**, **blog posts**, **X/Twitter updates**, **side projects**, and even **design portfolios** from Dribbble/Behance.
- Track your progress on current goals (learning, shipping, contributions).
- Show availability for **collabs, freelance, mentoring, or DAO work**.
- Showcase pinned **products (with real-time metrics)**, **NFTs**, or **grants** received.
- Share a beautiful, **customizable public link** like `devboard.io/yourhandle` â€” think Twitter bio link, but dev-focused.
